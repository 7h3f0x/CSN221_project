# Exploratory Study of Latest Prefetching Technologies

## Abstract
The past decade has seen an exponential rise in computing speeds and abilities, which only seem to be
limited by the laws of physics and the inherent memory transfer latencies due to the imperfections in our designs.
Prefetching, i.e, exploiting the overlap of processor computations with data accesses, is one of several approaches to
improve our tolerance towards these memory latencies. The process itself is both Hardware and Software directed
with some of the most sophisticated systems combining both these techniques. In this Exploratory Research
Project we will try to unmask the qualitative and quantitative impacts of existing prefetching methodologies with
special focus on correlation based techniques. When complex data access patterns are considered, the software
approach has compile-time information to perform sophisticated prefetching whereas the hardware scheme has
the advantage of manipulating dynamic information.
