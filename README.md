# Exploratory Study of Performance Evaluation Models for Latest Prefetching Technologies

## Abstract
The past decade has seen an exponential rise in computing speeds and abilities, which only seem to be limited by the laws of physics and the inherent memory transfer latencies due to the imperfections in our designs. Prefetching, i.e, exploiting the overlap of processor computations with data accesses, is one of several approaches to improve our tolerance towards these memory latencies. The process itself is both Hardware and Software directed with some of the most sophisticated systems combining both these techniques.
In this Exploratory Research Project we will try to unmask the qualitative and quantitative impacts of existing prefetching methodologies. When complex data access patterns are considered, the software approach has compile-time information to perform sophisticated prefetching whereas the hardware scheme has the advantage of manipulating dynamic information. 
Exploiting the data collected by vigorous research across various papers using some of the standard benchmarks, we focus our studies on the improvements in hit-rates, memory latencies, and instruction execution overheads in some of the modern day prefetching technologies. Finally, as the end product of our research, we aim to predict the technology which is the best fit for market use, i.e., both economical as well as which reduces the memory latency with least overhead.
